## Common Implementation Patterns
```typescript
// Role-based component rendering
{user?.user_metadata?.role === 'poster' && <PostJobButton />}

// TanStack Query with Supabase
const { data: jobs, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['jobs', filters],
  queryFn: () => jobsService.getJobs(filters)
})

// Form with React Hook Form + Zod
const form = useForm<JobFormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(jobSchema),
  defaultValues: { ... }
})

// Drizzle ORM database query
const jobs = await db.select()
  .from(jobsTable)
  .where(and(
    eq(jobsTable.status, 'active'),
    sql`ST_DWithin(location, ST_Point(${lng}, ${lat}), ${radius})`
  ))
  .limit(20)

// RLS policy implementation
await supabase.rls.create('jobs_select_policy', {
  table: 'jobs',
  operation: 'SELECT',
  check: 'auth.uid() = poster_id OR status = \'active\''
})
```

## Avoid Suggesting
- Manual JWT implementation (use Supabase Auth instead)
- Client-side storage of sensitive data
- Direct database queries from frontend (use API endpoints)
- Hardcoded API endpoints (use environment variables)
- Inline styles instead of Tailwind classes
- Complex state management libraries like Redux (prefer TanStack Query + React state)
- Manual database migrations (use Drizzle migrations)
- Custom authentication flows (leverage Supabase Auth)
- Untyped database queries (always use Drizzle ORM with TypeScript)
- Missing RLS policies (always implement proper security)
- localStorage for authentication tokens (Supabase handles this)
- Unvalidated API inputs (always use Zod schemas)
- Missing error boundaries and loading states
- Direct Stripe API calls from frontend (use backend proxy)
- Unoptimized geographic queries (use PostGIS functions)

## Security Best Practices to Enforce
- Always implement RLS policies for database access
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas on both client and server
- Use environment variables for all secrets and configuration
- Implement proper CORS configuration for production
- Use Helmet.js for security headers
- Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Never expose database credentials or internal IDs to frontend
- Use Supabase Auth for all authentication flows
- Implement proper error handling without exposing internal details
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate user permissions on every API endpoint
- Implement proper session management and token refresh
